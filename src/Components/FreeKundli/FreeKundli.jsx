          At the core of astrological practice lies the concept of the "Horoscope" or "Kundli." The Janam Kundli, often synonymous with a birth chart or horoscope, stands as a fundamental and significant cornerstone of astrology. The Janam Kundli does more than just show where stars and planets were when someone was born. People think it's important in how their life turns out. By looking at the positions of stars and planets, people believe they can understand things about themselves and their future. It's like getting guidance from the universe. The Janam Kundli is like a snapshot of the universe when you were born, and it helps connect you to the big cosmic picture. It's a way of showing how we're connected to everything around us.
